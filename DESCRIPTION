Description: 'rocnp' provides a set of tools for working with Romanian personal 
    numeric codes. The central tool is a validation function which applies 
    several verification criteria, as defined in the legislation, to assess the 
    validity of the numeric code. This is accompanied by functionality for 
    extracting the different components of a personal numeric code.
