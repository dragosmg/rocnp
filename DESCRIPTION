Description: A set of tools for working with Romanian personal numeric
    codes.  The core is a validation function which applies several
    verification criteria to assess the validity of numeric codes. This is
    accompanied by functionality for extracting the different components
    of a personal numeric code. A personal numeric code is issued to all
    Romanian residents either at birth or when they obtain a residence
    permit.
