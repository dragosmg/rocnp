The goal of `rocnp` is to provide a set of functions for working with Romanian
personal numeric codes. 

## Installation

You can install the released version of rocnp from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
#install.packages("rocnp")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
#library(rocnp)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

## Things to document

NAs are contagious
invalid CNPs will throw an error, forcing you to confront then early. Easiest to use 
`check_cnp_is_valid()` first.
