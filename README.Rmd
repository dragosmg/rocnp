## Installation

You can install the released version of rocnp from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
#install.packages("rocnp")
```

```{r example}
#library(rocnp)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.
