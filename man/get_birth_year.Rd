\title{Extract Birth Year from the Personal Numeric Code}
\usage{
get_birth_year(cnp_dec)
}
\arguments{
\item{cnp_dec}{a named character vector representing a decomposed Personal
Numeric Code}
}
\value{
an integer of length 1 representing the year of birth
}
\description{
This function infers the year of birth based on the code for gender - which
is indicative of the century of birth - and the \code{AA} component denoting the
last 2 digits of the birth year. The main purpose of this function is to help
the \code{interpret_cnp()} functionality. Thus, the year is returned as string,
especially since for residents not born in Romania, there might be two
possible valid values for the birth year.
